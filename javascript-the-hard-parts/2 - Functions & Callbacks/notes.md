# Functions & Callbacks
---
### Notes
- Generalizing Functions
  - **Parameters** (placeholder) mean we don't need to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function
    - Then provide an actual value (**argument**) when we then invoke that function call
  - Higher order functions follow the same principle
    - We may not want to decide exactly what some of our functionality is until we run our function.
- Functions are first class objects
  - Functions can be treated just like objects
- Arrow Functions
  - Can increase legibility (less words / prettier on page) but reduce readability

### Definitions (Functions & Callbacks)
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Higher Order Function: Accepts a function as a parameter or returns a function
- Callback: Function that is passed in as an argument to a parameter
- Arrow functions: shorthand way to save functions
